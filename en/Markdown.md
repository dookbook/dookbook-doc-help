# Markdown

**Markdown** is a simple markup language that allows one to write documents
using a text editor and transform those documents into many different formats,
such as *HTML*, *Word*, images, *PDF*, *epub*, etc.
Among other things, it works beautifully for documenting source code since the
Markdown documents can be checked in and versioned with *Git* or your source
control system of choice.

Markdown language is created by *John Gruber* in 2004.

The *suffix* of the documents written by Markdown are `.md` or `.markdown`.
